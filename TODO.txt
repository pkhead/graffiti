- are constants TRUE, FALSE, VOID, QUOTE, RETURN, e.t.c. globals or built into the language? (aka keywords)
- boolean operations don't do short-circuiting
- lingo does not have booleans. a truthy value is a non-zero integer
  (using a float in a conditional, or any other data type, results in an error)

- TODO (ALSO VERY IMPORTANT!!!!):
    replace KEYWORD and IDENTIFIER token types with WORD. maybe the WORD token
    type will have an extra field called short_type, which will simulate keyword
    enum.

    (although maybe i will keep KEYWORD but only for things which truly cannot
     be used in Lingo as identifiers. which would those be?)

- TODO: allow drizzle type information (obv ignore it)

three types of scripts:
- movie
    "attached" to the entire movie. handlers defined there are global
- behavior
    - attached to a frame, handlers defined there are global to that frame
    - can also be attached to regular sprites
- parent
    - basically a class template i guess. not attached to anything i think.

====================
property ancestor, thing2

on new me
  ancestor = new(script "parent1")
  me.thing2 = "bar"
  return me
end

-- handlers are called with obj.handler()
-- me is automatically assigned as the first parameter to handler
-- property variables work regardless or not the handler defines me
-- i guess it would compile to
--
-- (self would always be inserted)
-- function script.handler(self)
--   local LN_me = self
-- end
--
-- QUESTION: can you instantiate scripts that are not marked as parent scripts?
======================

unimplemented keywords:
- char ... of ...
  char ... to ... of ...
  a.char[x..y]
- exit (page 227)
- exit repeat = break
- field(...) (page 228)
- item ... of ...
  item ... to ... of ...
  a.item[x..y]
- line ... of ...
  line ... to ... of ...
- next repeat (aka continue)
- put ... before ... (after is implemented)
  put ... into char/word/line X of ... (replaces)
- repeat while
  repeat with x = y to z
  repeat with x = y down to z
  repeat with var in someList
- sprite X intersects Y
  sprite X within Y
  (or maybe are these actually generic and the pdf is lying)
- go
- line X of Y
  word X of Y (mayeb this exists?)
  character X or Y (maybe this exists?)

the:
- moviePath = _movie.path
- randomSeed
- frame
- dirSeparator
- number of lines/words(?)/characters(?) in X

probably i can identify if it's a "phrase" if there are two identifiers next to
each other.

str.chars[x]
str.char[x]

str.word

str.line

on beginSprite me
  QUOTE = "test"
  put QUOTE -- yields "
end
