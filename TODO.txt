- are constants TRUE, FALSE, VOID, QUOTE, RETURN, e.t.c. globals or built into the language? (aka keywords)

unimplemented keywords:
- char ... of ...
  char ... to ... of ...
  a.char[x..y]
- exit (page 227)
- exit repeat = break
- field(...) (page 228)
- item ... of ...
  item ... to ... of ...
  a.item[x..y]
- line ... of ...
  line ... to ... of ...
- next repeat (aka continue)
- put ... after/before ...
  put ... into character/word/line X of ... (replaces)
- repeat while
  repeat with x = y to z
  repeat with x = y down to z
  repeat with var in someList
- sprite X intersects Y
  sprite X within Y
  (or maybe are these actually generic and the pdf is lying)
- go
- line X of Y
  word X of Y (mayeb this exists?)
  character X or Y (maybe this exists?)

the:
- moviePath = _movie.path
- randomSeed
- frame
- dirSeparator
- number of lines/words(?)/characters(?) in X

probably i can identify if it's a "phrase" if there are two identifiers next to
each other.
